Switch from devilspie to devilspie2
Migrate all dotfiles from .dotfiles (zsh left to do)
Create a jQueryFetcher, which takes the url and hash and:

- query: the query to run
- regex (optional): regex to match against the href/src of the results of the query
- group (optional): which regex group use as the url (defaults to the whole match)
  or
- js: instead of query, it can take arbitrary js
  It loads the page, injects jQuery, and then either uses query or js to get a list of urls to download. It downloads them to $out. If it's just 1 url, then $out is a file, if it's more then $out is a folder.

add to zsh: export $(dbus-launch)

Make a new option called games, separated by roms by system, non-steam pc, flashpoint, etc...
similar to how SteamRomManager does it, including file generation and steamgriddb image fetching.
games that already exist in nixpkgs should be semi-autosupported.
