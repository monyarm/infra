Switch from devilspie to devilspie2
Migrate all dotfiles from .dotfiles (zsh left to do)
Create a jQueryFetcher, which takes the url and hash and:

- query: the query to run
- regex (optional): regex to match against the href/src of the results of the query
- group (optional): which regex group use as the url (defaults to the whole match)
  or
- js: instead of query, it can take arbitrary js
  It loads the page, injects jQuery, and then either uses query or js to get a list of urls to download. It downloads them to $out. If it's just 1 url, then $out is a file, if it's more then $out is a folder.

add to zsh: export $(dbus-launch)

Hardcoded Password:

- home/config/WebDav.nix: webdavAuth = "user:strongpassword";

Empty Password/API Key Fields (action required):

- home/config/MPV/script-opts/dvd_browser.nix: wsl_password = "";
- home/config/ComicTagger.nix: cv_api_key = "";
- home/config/Minecraft.nix: accessToken = "";

Secrets Managed by `sops` (good practice):

- home/config/MPV/script-opts/lrc.nix: musixmatch_token
- home/config/Nix.nix: github_access_token
- home/config/Minecraft.nix: mojangClientToken

JetBrains License Keys (need to migrate to secrets):

- hosts/home/monyarm/config/JetBrains/.CLion2018.3/config/clion.key
- hosts/home/monyarm/config/JetBrains/.PhpStorm2019.1/config/phpstorm.key
- hosts/home/monyarm/config/JetBrains/.WebStorm2019.1/config/webstorm.key
